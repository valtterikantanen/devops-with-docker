I optimized the production version of the server image for my todo app. The development environment was already containerized in exercise 2.11.

The starting point can be seen from the file [`before.Dockerfile`](./before.Dockerfile). The size of this image was 1.25GB.

The following changes were made:

- The base image was changed from `node:20` to a smaller `node:20-alpine` (292MB, −988MB).
- Two-stage build was implemented: the first stage installs the dependencies and transpiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript and the second stage copies the transpiled files and `node_modules` (205MB, −87MB).
- Removed development dependencies after transpiling the TypeScript code (163MB, −42MB).
- Added the command `USER node` to run the application as a non-root user. The official Node.js images come with a user `node` pre-created so I decided to use that (163MB, ±0MB).

The final image size is 163MB, which means it's 1.09GB (87.3%) smaller than the original image. The final version of the Dockerfile can be seen from the file [`after.Dockerfile`](./after.Dockerfile).
